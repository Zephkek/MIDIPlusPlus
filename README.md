MIDI++ v1.0.4 is an advanced MIDI Autoplayer and MIDI to Qwerty conversion program, developed over five months of intensive optimization and real-world testing. It combines the fastest MIDI-to-QWERTY conversion engine available with an also unmatched auto-player system, setting new standards for both live play and automated performance.

### Perfect for Both Live Players and Auto-Performance
- **Live Players**: Experience true 1:1 MIDI input with zero perceptible delay, and support for velocity sensitive qwerty keyboards.
- **Auto-Performance**: Load and play complex MIDI files with perfect timing
- **Hybrid Use**: Seamlessly switch between live play and auto-performance

### What Sets MIDI++ Apart
- Built from the ground up for maximum performance
- Optimized specifically for virtual piano applications
- Maintains perfect timing even under extreme load
- Developed and tested by professional virtual pianists and Audio engineers.

## Performance Benchmarks

- **Input Latency**: < 0.5ms from MIDI input to key press
- **Note Processing**: Up to 128 simultaneous notes with zero allocation
- **Memory Footprint**: ~50MB baseline, minimal GC impact
- **CPU Usage**: 2-5% average on modern processors
- **Timing Precision**: Nanosecond accuracy using advanced Timing algorithms that have been tested for months.
- **Throughput**: Can handle millions of notes per minute while maintaining stability and accuracy.

## 32 Step Velocity System

MIDI++ uses a 32-key velocity mapping system that converts MIDI velocities (0-127) into keyboard inputs. This system provides precise control over note dynamics while maintaining ultra-low latency.

### 32-Key Velocity Mapping

The velocity system uses this key sequence for mapping:
```
1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxc
```
Each character represents a different velocity level, where:
- Numbers (1-0): Lower velocity range
- Top row (q-p): Medium velocity range
- Home row (a-l): Medium-high velocity range
- Bottom row (z-c): Maximum velocity range

When playing, MIDI++ will automatically send "Alt + [key]" combinations based on the incoming MIDI velocity, allowing for precise dynamic control on games that support velocity sensitivty 

### Creating Custom Velocity Curves

You can create your own velocity curves through the configuration file. Each curve needs 32 values that map to the key sequence above.

Example custom curve configuration:
```json
{
    "CUSTOM_CURVES": [
        {
            "name": "MyCustomCurve",
            "values": [
                1,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,      First 10 values (number keys)
                40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,   Next 10 values (q-p)
                90,95,100,105,110,115,120,125,   Next 8 values (a-l)
                126,126,127,127                  Final 4 values (z-c)
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Custom Curve Guidelines:
- Values must be between 1-127
- Must provide exactly 32 values
- Values should generally increase or stay the same
- Consider your playing style when designing curves
- Test curves with different musical genres

### Practical Examples

1. **Gentle Curve** - For soft playing styles:
```json
"values": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,14,16,18,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,60,70,80,90,100,110,115,120,123,125,127]
```

2. **Aggressive Curve** - For dramatic dynamics:
```json
"values": [1,2,4,8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,72,80,88,96,104,110,115,120,124,126,127,127,127,127,127,127,127,127,127,127,127]
```

3. **Precision Control** - For fine control in middle velocities:
```json
"values": [1,2,4,8,16,24,32,40,48,56,60,64,68,72,76,80,84,88,92,96,100,104,108,112,116,120,122,124,125,126,127,127]
```

The system will automatically interpolate between these values to ensure smooth velocity transitions during play.
