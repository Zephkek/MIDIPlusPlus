## Installation

1. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x64) from [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
2. Download MIDI++ from the [Release Page](https://github.com/Zephkek/MIDIPlusPlus/releases/tag/Release)
3. Extract the package and place MIDI files in the "midi" folder
4. Launch MIDI++ to begin

## System Requirements

- Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- AVX2 supported CPU (Generally any CPU that's not older than 2013)
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2022 (x64)
- 100MB free disk space

## Features Usage Guide:


The following table explains the settings used in the `LEGIT_MODE_SETTINGS` JSON object:

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| ENABLED | Boolean | • Activates/deactivates Authenticity Mode<br>• When true, all other settings become active, and will load the MIDI file in legit mode |
| TIMING_VARIATION | Float<br>(0.0 to 1.0) | • Introduces timing deviations to each note<br>• 0.1 means ±10% variation in note timing<br>• Example: A note at 1.000s might play between 0.900s and 1.100s |
| NOTE_SKIP_CHANCE | Float<br>(0.0 to 1.0) | • Sets probability of missing a note<br>• 0.02 means 2% chance to skip any given note<br>• Simulates human errors in fast or complex passages |
| EXTRA_DELAY_CHANCE | Float<br>(0.0 to 1.0) | • Likelihood of inserting a pause between notes<br>• 0.05 means 5% chance of adding delay after a note<br>• Mimics human hesitation or breaths |
| EXTRA_DELAY_MIN | Float<br>(seconds) | • Minimum duration for random delays<br>• Should be ≤ EXTRA_DELAY_MAX |
| EXTRA_DELAY_MAX | Float<br>(seconds) | • Maximum duration for random delays<br>• Defines upper limit for added pauses |

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "LEGIT_MODE_SETTINGS": {
    "ENABLED": true,
    "TIMING_VARIATION": 0.1,
    "NOTE_SKIP_CHANCE": 0.02,
    "EXTRA_DELAY_CHANCE": 0.05,
    "EXTRA_DELAY_MIN": 0.05,
    "EXTRA_DELAY_MAX": 0.2
  }
}
```
# Volume Settings

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| MIN_VOLUME | 10 | • Minimum allowed volume level<br>• Represents 10% of maximum volume |
| MAX_VOLUME | 200 | • Maximum allowed volume level in your game<br>• Represents 200% of normal volume by default |
| INITIAL_VOLUME | 100 | • Starting volume level on initialization<br>• Represents 100% or "normal" volume |
| VOLUME_STEP | 10 | • Increment/decrement step for volume adjustments<br>• Each adjustment changes volume by 10 units by default |
| ADJUSTMENT_INTERVAL_MS | 50 | • Minimum time between volume adjustments<br>• Prevents changes more frequent than every 50 milliseconds by default|

## JSON Configuration

```json
{
    "VOLUME_SETTINGS": {
        "MIN_VOLUME": 10,
        "MAX_VOLUME": 200,
        "INITIAL_VOLUME": 100,
        "VOLUME_STEP": 10,
        "ADJUSTMENT_INTERVAL_MS": 50
    }
}
```
